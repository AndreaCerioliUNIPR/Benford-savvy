This folder contains the Fortran code:   

TestBenford_public.for

which can be used for replicating the simulation results presented in the article.

The input files required by the Fortran code are archived in file: 

TestBenford_input.zip

Each input file also includes a brief description of the parameters that the file itself 
contains.

The Fortran program has been run on a computer with 64 GB of RAM, i9 processor and 64-bit
operating system.

The Fortran program also makes use of some IMSL functions and routines. 
A compatible version (i.e., a version without IMSL routines) can be run from Matlab using 
a wrapper to the source file compiled using the mex function.
